This repository contains various scripts that I had to develop
at some point for various usages.

arpwatch-irc-email.pl
=====================

This script is doing a gateway between an arpwatch mailbox under the mbox
format and an irc channel. The idea was to be warned whenever a station's
MAC address on a LAN is changing, so that people can spot the culprit
quite quickly.

gen-pull.pl
===========

This script automates the creation, email address collection while sending
pull request for Linux' arm-soc maintainers. Supports sending the final email
if told so, but does not do it by default for safety.

pre-commit-email-check.sh
=========================

This script allows you to switch between corporate and private emails within the
same git tree by defining which on is which. It assumes that your private
remotes are going to have an URL which is private (obviously).

pre-commit-checkpatch.sh
========================

Runs checkpatch on an about to be committed patch.

wti-nps.py
==========

This script allows you to turn on/off/boot relays and get their status on a WTI
NPS-115 device connected via telnet.
